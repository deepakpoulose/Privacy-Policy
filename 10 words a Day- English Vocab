Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the 10 Words a Day – English Vocab app (hereafter referred to as “Application”) for mobile devices, created by Deepak P (hereafter referred to as “Service Provider”). This Application is provided as a free service and is intended to be used “AS IS.”

The Application does not collect any personally identifiable information from users. It may collect limited anonymized usage data, such as device type, operating system, time spent in the app, and pages visited, solely to improve app performance. This data cannot identify individual users. The Application does not track precise location of your device.

The Service Provider may use the information provided to contact users for important updates or notices, but no personal data is required for normal app usage. The Application does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Parents are encouraged to monitor their children’s use and instruct them not to submit personal information.

The Service Provider may disclose anonymized information if required by law, to protect rights or safety, or when working with trusted service providers who are bound to follow this Privacy Policy. Users can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application.

The Service Provider implements physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect any information processed by the Application. This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally, and continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of these changes.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2025-09-04. For any questions or concerns, contact the Service Provider at deepakppspprt@gmail.com
