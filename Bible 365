Privacy Policy – Bible365

This Privacy Policy applies to the Bible365 app (hereafter referred to as the “Application”) for mobile devices, created by Deepak P (hereafter referred to as the “Service Provider”). This Application is provided as a free service and is intended to be used “AS IS.”

Information Collection and Use

The Application does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.

It does not require or request any user permissions such as access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, or storage.

The Application functions purely as a Bible reading tool, allowing users to:

Read Bible verses,

Select books and chapters,

Track their reading progress for completing the Bible in 365 days,

Mark completed days,

Adjust font size for better readability.

All features operate without any form of data collection, and all progress data is stored locally on the user’s device.

Children’s Privacy

The Application does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.
Since no user data is collected at all, the Application is safe for all age groups.

Data Security

As the Application does not collect or transmit any data, there are no risks of data misuse or breaches.

The Service Provider takes user privacy seriously and ensures that the Application operates entirely offline, except for basic services like ad display (if enabled via Google AdMob), which follow Google’s privacy policies.

Third-Party Services

If the Application displays advertisements (e.g., via Google AdMob), please note that such services may independently collect limited, anonymized information as per their respective privacy policies.
